>The first blog, today, I learned the 5 minute tutorial of docusaurus, and the following is the record.

Introduction to docusaurus
--------------

Learn the 5-minute quick start course brought by docusaurus. The process of knowledge learning and writing down will be impressive,

And the query can be provided later.


Markdown page example
-----------------

It is so simple to create a page. In fact, markdown is suitable for purely displaying the content of the article, and the writing efficiency is relatively high.

Real is suitable for displaying complex effects and styles, suitable for propaganda page and complex page, with strong expressive power and low efficiency.

And react can access dynamic content, although it is a static generator, I don't know that docusaurus support.


How to create docusaurus page
---------------------

Docusaurus supports markdown documents and react components of mdx syntax.

Add markdown or react file to the directory "src/pages" to create a page. Docusaurus will automatically add routes consistent with the file name.

* `src/pages/index.js` -> ` localhost:3000/ `
* `src/pages/foo.md` -> ` localhost:3000/foo `
* `src/pages/foo/bar.js` -> ` localhost:3000/foo/bar `


What is docusaurus document
----------------------

A document is a page group connected by:

*A sidebar
*Navigation on previous and next pages
*Version

The corresponding route will be generated automatically by adding markdown file in the ` sr/docs' directory to create a document.

For example, add 'docs / hello.md' generation` http://localhost :3000/docs/hello`。

Sidebar generation, metadata needs to be added to the file header.

```markdown
---
sidebar_ label: 'Hi!' # Sidebar title
sidebar_ Position: 3 # position
---
```

Or, the file 'sidebar.js' is configured as shown. It is automatically generated by default.

Create blog page
------------

Every day blog articles need to create pages separately, including tag, RSS flow, index information.

Create file `blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md ', and generate routing according to slug` http://localhost :3000/blog/greetings`

```markdown
---
slug: greetings
title: Greetings!
author: Steven Hansel
author_ title: Docusaurus Contributor
author_ url: https://github.com/ShinteiMai
author_ image_ url: https://github.com/ShinteiMai.png
tags: [greetings]
---
```

There is no directory tree on the right side of this blog page. There are all the documents. See how to do it when you see it.

Blog supports the directory tree on the right, but it is OK to use the form of '###############šš෗#෗.


Markdown syntax support
---------------

###Links links

```markdown
Look at the markdown file I created
Let's see how to [my react page](/my-react-page).
```

Look at the markdown file I created

Let's see how to [my react page](/my-react-page).

###Images

The resources of the big logo image path `/static/img/dalogo.png',' static 'directory resources will be packaged and put into the root directory, and the direct absolute path reference can be used.

```md
![ Spark Store Logo](/img/dalogo.png)
```

![ Spark Store Logo](/img/dalogo.png)


###Code blocks

More title functions than normal markdown syntax.
````md
```jsx {3} title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</ h1>
  )
}
```
````

The display effect is as follows

```jsx {3} title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</ h1>
  )
}
```

###Admonitions prompt

Docusaurus has a special syntax to support warnings and annotations.

```md
:::note
Gray notice
:::

:::tip prompt message
This is a green message
:::

:::info default
This is the default message in blue
:::

::caution warning
This is the default yellow message
:::

:::danger
Red wechat message
:::

```

:::note

:::

:::tip prompt message
This is a green message
:::

:::info default
This is the default message in blue
:::

:::caution warning
This is the default yellow message
:::

:::danger
Red wechat message
:::

### MDX and React Components

Mdx allows documents to directly support the react component to interact.

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
<span
  style={{
    backgroundColor: color,
    borderRadius: '20px',
    color: '#fff',
    padding: '10px',
    cursor: 'pointer',
  }}
  onClick={() => {
    alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
}}>
  {children}
</span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !
This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !



Compilation and deployment
--------------------------

Docusaurus is a static site generator, also known as [jamstack]（ https://jamstack.org/ )[^1]

Compile the code of production environment, and the compiled static file will be generated in the directory "build"

```sh
#Execute compile command
$ npm run build

#Originally view the compiled effect
$ npm run serve
```

For detailed publishing to GitHub pages, refer to the official tutorial [deploying to GitHub pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying -to-githubbpages)

[^1]: jamstack is a principle of pre rendering and decoupling to make websites and applications more easy to use and flexible.
